### LLM Demos

A place to explore some work with LLMs.

Start with [this data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_pres_county.csv).

1. Does the site work as-is, or did you need to tweak it to work?

  For the most part, the site does work fairly well. The drop down button works and the percentages add up. The only thing that is looking wonky and not correct is the total number of votes that Harris has. 

3. Try improving the result, and updating the files based on the results. Did that help?

I had chat fix the harris number which it was able to do but then i lost the gride lines for the information but even without the lines the data is still easy to read. 

5. Think of a journalism circumstance where you might use this sort of technique that doesn't involve elections. Describe how you would do it.

This could be used for any set of data that deals with numbers and percentages like trying to track the total number of covid cases in each state by county or town. Essentially, it would use the same process as we have here for elections but for covid cases instead. I like the idea of having a drop down button and having the website be interactive. This allows the website to look clean but still have all of the important information needed.
